# CardGames

A card games coding challenge

## The Challenge

A deck of playing cards contains 52 cards in thirteen ranks (two
through Ace) and four suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and
Spades).

In your chosen programming language (C#, Javascript or C++
preferred) create a small library for implementing card games.
You should choose one or two card games with which you are
familiar as a guide, but understand that you are not expected to
implement a complete game.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of facets that you may want to
address:

* Cards are comparable. Consider:
  * the ability to decide whether a given card beats another card.
  * the ability to sort a collection of cards according to rank and suit.
  * not all games rank cards in the same way.
  * not all plays of the same game rank all cards in the same way.
* Most games involve a *deck* of cards. Consider:
  * games typically start with a shuffling of the deck.
  * not all games use a complete deck of cards
  * not all games use only one deck of cards
* Players often have a *hand* of cards. Consider:
  * some games deal the entire deck out to the players
  * some games deal only a portion of the deck out
  * some games don't start with each player receiving the same number of cards
